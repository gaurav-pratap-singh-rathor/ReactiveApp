The Reactive Book Management System is a robust and efficient web application developed using the principles of reactive programming in Java. It leverages the power of Spring WebFlux, a non-blocking web framework built for handling concurrency with a small number of threads and scaling with fewer hardware resources.

The system exposes a RESTful API that provides endpoints for managing and searching books. The management endpoints allow clients to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books. Each book has attributes such as id, title, description,  author, publisher.

The searching endpoints enable clients to search for books based on title. The search is performed in a non-blocking manner, ensuring the system remains responsive even under heavy load.

Built with a reactive architecture, the system is capable of handling a large number of requests concurrently, providing a seamless user experience. The use of Spring WebFlux ensures that the application can scale efficiently, making it suitable for environments with high traffic demands.

This project is an excellent demonstration of the power and efficiency of reactive programming in building scalable and resilient web services. It showcases how Spring WebFlux can be used to build non-blocking APIs, improving the overall performance and responsiveness of the application.
